    <h1>This is my academic profile</h1>
    <p>Joni P. Puranen

<h1>Profile</h1>
I am a Finnish philosopher working at the intersection of phenomenology, embodiment, and medical humanities. 
I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki, where I work in the Phenomenology 
of Loneliness project (from 2025 August to 2027 November) exploring the constitutive elements of being with others. 

In philosophy, my areas of expertise encompass currents in contemporary European thought (in particular Edmund Husserl, Martin 
Heidegger, Jean-Luc Nancy), phenomenolological psychopathology and the role of embodiment in mental health. 

I received my PhD in Philosophy from the University of Jyväskylä in April 2024 with the degree eximia cum laude approbatur. 
My dissertation, Attention and Bodily Experience, develops a phenomenological account of how bodily being shapes attentive 
experience. Before my doctoral work, I completed an MSocSci in philosophy at the University of Jyväskylä (2016) and a BA 
in philosophy at the University of Helsinki (2015).

I am currently (2025 November) working on on two texts: 
I am preparing to submit a text on experiences of longing, which demonstrates how the infinite withdrawal 
of my beloved is not simply the mark of absence but the very mode through which their withdrawn presence insists 
– how it is at once dreadful and consoling, exact and undeniable. 
I am drafting out a text that explores the sonorous materiality of LLM chatbots – how our engagement with them feels like a conversation?
